ML based Circuit Detector

This project aims at:
- Logic Gates type detection from handdrawn images (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR)
- Logic Gates rotation detection from the same images (0, 90, 180, 270)
- Wire detection from the same images (As a List of Points)
- Outputting xy Coordinates of the Above in a Clean Json format
- Visualling the output with a Computer Generated Image of the circuit

STATUS: Currently in Initial phase
