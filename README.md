# Circuit Metadata Detector

<img src="frontend/src/assets/banner.jpg" alt="Banner" width="500"/>


SketchLogic is a Circuit Metadata Detector that can detect logic gates, rotations, and wires from hand-drawn circuit sketches, export results as structured JSON and render a clean visualization.

It takes scanned jpg images of one (or more) Handdrawn circuits on a plain paper as input. (no lines on the paper) 

**Project Status:** *Development phase.*

## üì¶ Installation & Usage

### System Requirements: 

- Python 3.9 or Higher -> <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Download here</a>
- Node.js version 18 or Higher (includes npm) -> <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Download here</a>

Make sure both are installed properly by running these in a terminal:

```bash
python --version
node --version
npm --version
````

- MacOS, Linux, or Windows

### Installation:

Bellow is the recommended installation process for testing of this project. Please feel free to use any other approaches you prefer.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShahzaibAhmad05/SketchLogic.git
cd SketchLogic
````

Run the following script to automatically install all missing dependencies 
(Python packages, Node.js modules) and download the featured SKELO model:

```bash
python prerequisites.py
````

### Usage:

For this you‚Äôll need **two terminal windows** open, both in the project root (the folder where you cloned the repository):

- In the **first terminal**, start the backend (Flask API):

```bash
python backend/app.py
````

- In the second terminal, start the frontend (React app)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
````

The frontend will run on port 5173. Open <a href="http://localhost:5173/" target="_blank">localhost:5173</a> in your browser to view the app.
