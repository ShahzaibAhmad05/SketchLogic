# Security Policy

## Project Status
This project is currently under active development and has not had an official release.  
Breaking changes, incomplete features, and unpatched issues may exist.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please email **shahzaibahmad6789@gmail.com** with a clear description and, if possible, a proof of concept.  
Do not open a public issue for security reports.

I will acknowledge receipt within **24 hours** and, if confirmed, work on a fix as soon as possible.

## Supported Versions
There are no released versions at this time. Security fixes will be applied to the development branch (`main`) until the first official release.

## Disclosure
Once a fix is made, I will describe the issue in the commit or changelog and, if you agree, credit you as the reporter.
