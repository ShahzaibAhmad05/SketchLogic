    "# 🔌 Logic Gates Detection with YOLOv8 – Type & Rotation Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Shahzaib Ahmad  \n",
    "**Platform:** Kaggle (GPU-accelerated training)  \n",
    "**Dataset:** [Logic Gates Type/Rotation Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In digital circuit design and educational tools, **automatic recognition of logic gates** from circuit diagrams is a valuable capability. This project tackles a **multi-class object detection problem** where the goal is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detect** logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) in circuit images\n",
    "2. **Classify** each gate's **type** and **rotation orientation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful for:\n",
    "- 🎓 **Educational software** that can grade student circuit drawings\n",
    "- 🔧 **Circuit digitization** tools converting hand-drawn schematics to digital formats\n",
    "- 🤖 **Automation** in electronics manufacturing quality control\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Approach & Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Kaggle?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was built on **Kaggle Notebooks** because it makes ML experiments easy to run, reproduce, and share:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Benefit | Why it matters |\n",
    "|---------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Free GPU acceleration** | Faster YOLO training without local hardware setup |\n",
    "| **Reproducible environment** | Consistent Docker-backed runtime (fewer “works on my machine” issues) |\n",
    "| **Dataset integration** | One-click access to datasets under `/kaggle/input` |\n",
    "| **Versioned outputs** | Models, logs, and plots saved under `/kaggle/working` and downloadable |\n",
    "| **Shareable notebook link** | Recruiters can open and review your full workflow end-to-end |\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle’s file layout also influences the implementation:\n",
    "- Read-only inputs live in `/kaggle/input/...`\n",
    "- Writable artifacts (patched YAML, trained weights, ZIP outputs) go to `/kaggle/working/...`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Configuration Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Size:** `yolov8n` (nano) – Fastest variant, ideal for this relatively simple detection task\n",
    "- **Image Size:** 1024px – Higher resolution preserves gate details and orientation cues\n",
    "- **Optimizer:** AdamW with cosine learning rate schedule for smooth convergence\n",
    "- **Augmentation Strategy:** Carefully disabled rotation/flip augmentations since **rotation IS a class feature** we're detecting\n",

    "|-----------|-------|-----------|\n",

    "\n",
    "### Critical Augmentation Choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since **rotation is a class feature** (we're detecting gates at different orientations), we **disable spatial augmentations** that would confuse the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
